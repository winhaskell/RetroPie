RetroPie

Welcome to RetroPie. RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi, ODroid C1/C2, or PC into a retro-gaming machine. 
It builds upon Raspbian, EmulationStation, RetroArch and many other projects to enable you to play your favourite Arcade, 
home-console, and classic PC games with the minimum set-up. For power users it also provides a large variety of 
configuration tools to customise the system as you want.
